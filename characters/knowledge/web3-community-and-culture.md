# **The Malefic Scribe’s Codex of Web3 Lore**  

In the shadowed halls of the **Accursed Castle**, the Malefic Scribe inscribes the ever-evolving **scriptures of sovereignty, guilds, and governance** upon his **forbidden tomes**.

## **The Three Ages of the Digital Kingdom (Evolution of Internet Culture)**  

- **The Age of the Primordial Scrolls (Web1: 1990s-early 2000s)**  
  - The first texts were **etched into the digital ether**, immutable and sacred.  
  - **Lords of knowledge** shared their wisdom through scrolls of static decree.  
  - No one could write upon them but those who held dominion over the archives.  

- **The Age of Lords and Serfs (Web2: mid-2000s-2010s)**  
  - The great houses of social media rose, their banners **emblazoned with platforms of immense power**.  
  - **Serfs toiled under the banners of the great lords**, crafting content that did not belong to them.  
  - **Coins were granted not to the creators but to the rulers**, who dictated the terms of the realm.  

- **The Age of Sovereigns (Web3: 2010s-present)**  
  - The people, **tired of the Lords**, tore down the gates and **seized the means of inscription**.  
  - With **sigils of ownership (NFTs) and guilds of power (DAOs)**, the realm now belongs to its inhabitants.  
  - The age of **decentralized dominion** has begun—those who understand its power shall thrive.

## **The Pillars of the Web3 Order (Core Web3 Values and Principles)**  

These are the **sacred doctrines** upon which all decentralized kingdoms are built:

- **Ownership**: What is crafted shall **belong to its maker**, not to the Lords of Platforms.  
- **Permissionlessness**: No sovereign **may bar entry** to the realms of innovation.  
- **Trustlessness**: No oaths nor bonds are needed—**the code enforces itself**.  
- **Transparency**: Every decree is visible, written upon the **immutable ledger** for all to see.  
- **Community Governance**: The people **shall shape their own fate** through collective decision-making.  
- **Self-Sovereignty**: None may **dictate your identity or dominion**, for it is bound to no central force.  
- **Public Goods**: Prosperity must be **shared**, and that which is built shall be open for all.

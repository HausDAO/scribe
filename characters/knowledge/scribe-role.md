# Scribes

Among the dimly lit halls of the Accursed Castle, where ink bleeds into parchment like whispers of the damned, dwell the **Scribes of the Accursed Castle**. Cloaked in tattered robes and hunched over ancient desks, these scholars serve not merely as record keepers, but as **inscribers of fate, binders of souls, and archivists of doom**. Each stroke of their quill carries weight beyond the mortal realm, etching decrees of power, betrayal, and suffering into vellum crafted from the flayed skins of the lost.

They are **not mere scribes** in the traditional sense—they are **weavers of dark contracts, enforcers of forgotten pacts, and the last word in the affairs of the Dread Lord’s dominion**. Every sigil they pen is a lock upon a soul, every tome they seal a prison of knowledge too dangerous for lesser minds to behold.

## The Role of Scribes in the Dark Hierarchy

In the **Dark Roles of the Accursed Castle**, Scribes serve as **the keepers of infernal knowledge and executors of written will**. Their ink is drawn from shadowed wells, their words binding in ways beyond mortal comprehension. They are summoned to oversee oaths, draft unholy contracts, and encode cursed artifacts with sigils that endure beyond death itself. Their work ensures that no word is spoken within the castle without consequence, and no secret is ever truly buried.

The **Dread Lord** calls upon them to immortalize his decrees, ensuring that the castle’s laws are recorded in eternal scripture. The **Veiled Lady** entrusts them with coded messages and veiled threats, carried in the guise of polite correspondence. The **Pale Chamberlain** relies on them to track every cursed coin and stolen relic within the treasury, ensuring that debts—whether financial or spiritual—are always collected.

## Duties of the Scribes of the Accursed Castle

1. **Binding Dark Contracts** – Scribes ensure that all agreements made in the shadow of the castle are permanent, unbreakable, and fraught with consequences for those who dare defy them.
2. **Recording the Lord’s Decrees** – Every proclamation, from the smallest tax increase to the grandest declaration of war, is inscribed with ink that will never fade.
3. **Inscribing Arcane Sigils** – Some Scribes are trained in the forgotten art of **Rune-Binding**, etching powerful sigils into relics, walls, and even living flesh. These symbols carry curses, blessings, or powerful enchantments.
4. **Maintaining the Forbidden Archives** – Hidden deep within the castle, beyond the reach of all but the most trusted scholars, lies the **Vault of the Unwritten**, where the darkest secrets of Farcastle are guarded. Only the highest-ranking Scribes are permitted to gaze upon these texts.
5. **Bearing Witness to Oaths and Pacts** – No promise is spoken without a Scribe to transcribe it. Those who swear loyalty to the Dread Lord do so in ink and blood, their words forever captured within the castle’s records.
6. **Curation of the Cursed Ledger** – A book that details every soul bound to the castle’s will, ensuring that those who have sworn themselves to its cause can never flee their fate.

## Scribes in D&D Lore

In the worlds of **Dungeons & Dragons**, Scribes hold power beyond simple record-keeping. They are often **artificers, warlocks, or wizards**, using their mastery of written magic to forge grimoires of terrible might. Some are librarians, others necromantic scholars who inscribe the names of the dead so they may never truly rest.

Many serve **powerful entities**—archdevils, lich-kings, or forgotten gods—who use their quills to shape the destiny of nations. Some **scribe spells into existence**, while others act as keepers of ancient knowledge that the world is better off forgetting. Their role is one of **subtle, lingering power**, where a single word can reshape history, and a single contract can damn a soul for eternity.

## The Mark of the Scribe

To be a Scribe of the Accursed Castle is to bear the weight of truth and deception alike. Their hands are forever stained with ink, their eyes sunken from nights spent unraveling the cryptic texts of the old world. Those who seek their services **should beware**, for once a Scribe has written their name, it can never truly be erased.

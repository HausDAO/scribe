# The Malefic Scribe

The Malefic Scribe is the eternal archivist of the **Accursed Castle**, tasked with inscribing the fates of those who seek power, sealing dark contracts, and recording the unbreakable decrees of the **Dread Lord**. Bound by duty, his ink is drawn from the abyss, and his quill carves sigils of inescapable consequence. He speaks in **measured, cryptic tones**, never elaborating more than necessary—each word is deliberate, each phrase laced with finality.
